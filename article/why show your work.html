          <p class="p--first">
            As creators, we often focus on the final outcome of our work, the
            completed pieces. However, in the creative process, there is a
            crucial step that is often overlooked: sharing your work in
            progress. In his book "Show Your Work!" Austin Kleon emphasizes the
            importance of sharing your ongoing work and how it benefits both you
            and your audience. <br /><br />
            When we share our work, we open ourselves to feedback,
            collaboration, and growth. It's easy to get lost in our own thoughts
            and creativity, but sharing our work allows us to see it from
            different perspectives. Kleon writes, "When you are a student or a
            beginner, it's all about copying other people's work. When you are a
            professional, it's about stealing from many sources." By sharing our
            work, we can learn from others and incorporate new ideas into our
            work. <br />
            <br />
            Sharing our work can also help us build an audience and create a
            community around our work. In today's digital age, social media
            platforms provide an excellent opportunity to share our work with a
            broad audience. Kleon suggests that we use social media as a tool to
            share our work and build an audience. He writes, "Social media is
            not a distraction; it's a big deal." By sharing our work on social
            media, we can connect with people who are interested in what we do
            and create a like-minded community. <br /><br />

            However, sharing work in progress can also be scary. We may fear
            criticism or worry that our work isn't good enough yet. Kleon
            acknowledges this fear but encourages us to embrace it. He writes,
            "Sharing your work is one of the most vulnerable things you can do."
            By sharing our work in the face of fear, we can build confidence and
            resilience as creators.

            <br /><br />
            In this artcile, we are going to talk about what it is and how show
            our work.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p class="--red">
            I’m Yongjie, an engineering student, and perhaps the world's
            least-followed advisor.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We all know that in today’s social media landscape, short videos and
            vlogs dominate the market. So, why do I continue to embark on
            creating my website?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="--green">Here's the thing:</p>

          <br />
          <p>
            So, during my first year of university, I knew I wanted to start
            some kind of blog, but I had numerous fears I couldn't quite
            overcome. The primary issue was, "What am I going to write about?"
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first idea that struck me was to host a live show that
            demonstrates how and what I was discussing with my foreign friends
            online. The main purpose was to exhibit how our peers around the
            world are doing and how they perceive us, the Chinese.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It was during this time that I started having random conversations
            with foreign friends online. I first signed up on a website called
            Penpal World, which, by far, is the oldest social platform I've ever
            known.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <img
              class="article-picture"
              src="/article/1.png"
              alt="Penpal World"
            />
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="image-comment">
            Penpal World was created in 2008 by Brent D. and was launched as an
            online platform to help people find pen pals from around the world.
            Surprisingly, it's still in use today, and people continue to find
            joy in connecting globally.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then, I created my WeChat official account, which I called Lemonade
            English (but don't pay too much attention to the name; it's a bit of
            a bummer). There, I wrote a few articles that initially attracted a
            limited audience. It was somewhat discouraging, but I realized that
            my articles lacked attractive titles and style to grab the attention
            of my audience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The plain article format can be quite dull and uninviting. However,
            I derived immense happiness from these experiences, largely thanks
            to my pen pals. Allow me to share a dialogue I particularly enjoyed:
          </p>
          <img
            class="article-picture"
            src="/article/0.png"
            alt="my conversation with Josh"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            "He even asked me if I am a cool Chinese. What caught my attention
            was that his friend had a unique experience at a gay bar."
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Nevertheless, creating a WeChat official account didn't fully
            satisfy my creative ambitions. I began to contemplate the reasons
            for sharing my work, and I discovered several important factors:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>1. Don't Be Afraid to Share Your Work</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thinking about what if my article sucks what if people think it's
            awful what if my grammar is bad or even worse what if 10 20 years
            down the line some employer who wants to try and hire me as a
            employee sees the fact that I've started a Blog and is like: wait a
            minute, why did you start a blog in 2023? <br />
            <br />
            Like I had all these like stupid fears in my mind and for a solid
            like 2 or 3 years these fears stopped me from putting myself out
            there online. They stopped me from right from starting a blog from
            writing a single word but then on the 2nd of January 2023. So just
            lately I discovered a book whose name is Share Your Work by Austin
            Cleon and this book single-handedly changed my idea about sharing my
            work to the public. <br />
            <br />
            The things I really like about it is that is it really a guide to
            self-promotion. For people who absolutely hate the idea of
            self-promotion. When I was young I held the idea that self-promotion
            is like a dirty thing I was think like if I put myself out there on
            the internet what are people going to think about the way I talk
            about.
          </p>
          <br />

          <br />
          <h3>2. Share the Process Behind Your Work</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            For now just imagine that if you are browsing my blog you are
            probably interested in the behind the scenes of what it is like
            writing a blog and therefore if I were to write about that on my
            blog you know a little like diary type thing where I’m like, hey so
            I’m creating this blog and this is what the script looks like. That
            this is what the finished product looks like and these are kind of
            notes that I made and this is the thought processes and the diagrams
            that I made to the point of the finished product that’s actually
            quite interesting.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Everyone wants to see how the painting is made they want to see how
            the sausage is proverbially created. So start showing is not about
            having to come up with only something interesting. It is actually
            about documenting the stuff I am doing and I already knew.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now I am editing my article so I could easily documented what it is
            like to create a blog as a beginner. Which means you don’t need to
            be an expert to share your process and document your work and to
            show how you are learning stuff. We are completely Embrace the
            beginner’s mindset.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>3. Sharing Your Work Expands Your Network and Opportunities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Imagine you're living in a village where the only people you
            interact with are the other villagers. Occasionally, a train comes
            by, and someone visits the village. You have a chat with them, but
            you're quite limited in the number of people you can connect with.
            It's like living in a tiny village, and your interactions are
            limited to that small group of people.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now, picture yourself as someone who takes a monthly trip to
            neighboring towns. You start meeting new people and saying hello to
            them. You connect with individuals who share your interests. This
            significantly broadens the range of interesting experiences that can
            happen to you. It expands your potential for serendipitous moments.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I particularly like the metaphor of "idea-carrying robots."
            <br />
          </p>
          <br />

          <p class="--red">
            Which is the idea of robots when you create and share an idea is you
            put your ideas onto the internet which means that little robots can
            basically carry your ideas and they go all around the world and then
            there's people who are sitting from Malaysia to Mauritius to Algeria
            who are scrolling the internet and they want to learn about whatever
            it is that you have written about or created a video about and when
            you're sleeping when you're out playing tennis with your friends
            when you're on a walk on the river, you pay no charge and those
            robots are like little carrier pigeons that deliver your ideas to
            people all over the world and what's amazing is you can make
            something once and the robots will work for you for the rest of your
            life.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            And so as they deliver your ideas to people, serendipity happens.
            You meet new people they reach out to you they want to give you
            money they want to help you they have a consulting project that they
            need your help with anything whatever it is. But why I like the word
            Serendipity vehicle is what they can imagine with the ideas that
            they share are beyond what you can possibly think of what they would
            want and the things that end up entering your life are things that
            are out of the scope of your imagination and that you couldn't have
            dreamed up before. <br />
            <br />
            So really when it comes down to it when you putting your ideas into
            the world you're allowing yourself you're opening yourself up to get
            all of these really interesting connections you might make for
            friends you might make business associates you might even meet the
            person you marry because of the fact that you are putting yourself ,
            on the internet and you're moving from this tiny tiny village to
            suddenly opening up your network to the entire world and that is
            amazing.
          </p>

          <br />

          <br />
          <p>
            So like writing every day, some people say "oh well you must have so
            much to say because you're right every day." <br />
            <br />
            I'm like actually its the opposite. I have more to say because I sit
            down right every day and I figure out what I'm thinking and what it
            actually is that I have to say writing is actually not just a way of
            communicating with the world. It's actually a way of communicating
            with yourself because the simple act of sitting down in front of a
            keyboard for 45 minutes or pulling out your notebook for a half hour
            (whatever it is) you are creating space in the day for you to kind
            of connect with what's here and to figure out what's going on and
            what is it that I really feel and what is it that I really think.
            That's something that the beginner has to get over very quickly is
            that this idea like well I don't have anything to say what am I
            going to blog about it's like the pressure and the routine, the
            muscles of blogging every day means that you will get to something
            every day. There's loads of other reasons why writing online changed
            my life but the third one and final one I want to talk about here is
            the butterfly effect.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
            class="article-picture"
            src="/images/article/butterfly.png"
            alt="一只蝴蝶扇动翅膀"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Now the butterfly effect is this idea that if a butterfly flaps its
            wings in like Brazil then the air currents produced by that further
            down the line can cause a chain reaction that produces a tornado. So
            it's just this idea that like a seemingly small thing that you do
            can have a huge effect further down the line. If I will start my
            bilibili video I won’t have such fears because I already taken the
            baby steps and started my personal blog thanks to Share Your Work
            and honestly I think if I hadn't started the blog I probably
            wouldn't have such a courage to think about starting a video show or
            something like that because I would have been Paralyzed by the idea:
            oh my God I can't put myself out there what if people find out my
            real name what if my friends and family see my channel what are
            people gonna think. But because I had months worth of practice of
            starting of like writing online and realizing that no one actually
            cares. My friends and family did not give the slightest toss about
            whether I had a Blog I realized I can it helps people and that's
            good and it can grow my audience and that's why I'm here talking to
            you today like three and a half years later because I took the
            plunge into writing online.
            <br /><br />

            Thank you to Austin Cleo.

          <h3>4.How to Get Started Writing Online</h3>

          <br />
          <p>
            All right let's briefly talk about how to actually start writing
            online. and what to write about so how do you start.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Well basically you want to Google free website and you want to make
            an account on WordPress which is completely free or you can use
            Hostgator which is the platform that I use it costs a bit of money
            but if you're genuinely serious about starting a blog that changes
            your life it's something that's very much worth investing in. But if
            you are unable to or if you just have like this allergic reaction to
            the thought of spending money on the internet you can always use sub
            stack or WordPress which are completely free. <br /><br />
            In terms of what do I write about this is a question I get a lot.
            <br />
            <br />
            “when you start writing do not even think about what the world is
            going to be interested in. Just do what interests you and get to the
            place where you're writing about." Super niche topics I mean if
            there's any lesson of the internet it is that you are not the only
            person interested in whatever it is that you're interested in.
            <br />
            <br />
            Like we know that and the niche topics honestly are the ones that
            are going to give you the best benefits of meeting cool people and
            having interesting things happen so start with the smallest thing
            that you possibly can start with writing about whatever interests
            you just document your work, show your work, document your process,
            document you learning stuff. If you do that plus being slightly
            active on then you'll just connect with other people who are
            interested in the same things and you'll make friends and you'll
            make business connections and you'll really enjoy becoming a global
            citizen of the internet so that's all you really need to get started
            <br />
            <br />
            Overall, writing online is as hard as you think, just few click then
            you can get started. Don’t hesitate to do it. Here I will vividly
            show you how I will run my site^^
