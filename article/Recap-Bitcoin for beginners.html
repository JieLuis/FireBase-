            All right, let's talk about crypto. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you've probably heard the word Bitcoin floating around. You
            might have seen the price has been skyrocketing recently. You
            might've seen that Tesla has bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin
            and is gonna start accepting it as payment. And you might have heard
            of all these weird things called a Dogecoin which are apparently
            going to the moon. <br /><br />

            As such, this blog is my personal guide to the world of Bitcoin and
            cryptocurrencies. And it's the blog that I wanna be able to send to
            my friends whenever they ask me, Hey are you investing in Bitcoin?
            Why are you investing in Bitcoin? How does it work? Is it safe? Are
            you gonna lose your money? Isn't it illegal? All of this sort of
            stuff. <br /><br />

            So in this article, which is for informational purposes only and
            should absolutely not be construed as financial advice. In the
            slightest, we're gonna split it up into four parts. Firstly, I'll
            talk about what Bitcoin is and how cryptocurrencies in general work
            and why they work and why they're legit. Secondly, we'll talk about
            why Bitcoin and crypto is so controversial and I'll share my hot
            takes about that. Thirdly, we'll talk about, why I personally do
            invest in Bitcoin and crypto. And fourthly, we'll talk about how you
            can get started investing in crypto. If that's the sort of thing you
            want to do with lots and lots of caveats and cautionary tales along
            the way.
            <br /><br />

            My name is Yongjie, I'm a engineering student and world
            least-followed advisor.
            <br /><br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Part1</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Anyway, let's get into section number one. All right, so let's take
            things back to basics to try and build up our understanding of
            Bitcoin from the ground up. Now, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. There
            are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies out there but Bitcoin is like
            the original, the OG. And it's by far the biggest cryptocurrency
            around, which makes the question, what is a cryptocurrency?
            <br /><br />

            So here's my definition of a cryptocurrency based on four central
            concepts. A cryptocurrency is a virtual currency based on a ledger
            which is decentralized and secured by cryptography. All right, so
            firstly, Bitcoin is a virtual currency.
            <br /><br />

            Now what is a currency? A currency is just a medium of exchange.
            It's what replaces the old school bartering system we used to have,
            when it would be like, I will give you this bushel of wheat in
            return for the shoe that you have kindly made me because you are a ,
            maybe a leather worker. Obviously, that system of bartering is quite
            inefficient because you have to store a lot of stuff that other
            people want and that's just a bit of a pain. And so we invented
            currency in the form of coins usually as a system that everyone
            recognized to be able to exchange stuff without having the physical
            goods. So I could sell my bushel of wheat for two copper coins and
            then I could save up my copper coins and I could buy your shoes for
            10 copper coins, for example.
            <br /><br />

            Back in the day currency itself was tied to metals like gold and
            silver and copper, which had like different values. And so the
            actual metal of the coins was worth something because everyone
            agreed that these metals were somewhat precious but in modern times,
            most of our currency takes the form of paper notes and paper notes
            aren't inherently worth anything because the paper is just worth
            paper but currency is worth something because everyone agrees that
            it's worth something.
            <br /><br />

            If I take $100 dollars almost anywhere in the world most people, I
            mean most places in the world will recognize that $100 is worth $100
            and I'd be able to buy $100 worth of stuff from it. If
            hypothetically the whole world were to tomorrow decide that the U S
            dollar is a meaningless currency and they're not gonna accept it for
            anything at all. Then the US dollar would be worthless. So really
            when it comes to currency it doesn't mean anything real. Currency is
            kind of just an abstract way that we've all agreed to value things
            in a certain way. So coming back to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is virtual
            currency. It is a digital form of currency, i.e. (The abbreviation
            "i.e." stands for "id est" in Latin, which translates to "that is"
            or "in other words" in English. It is used to introduce a rephrasing
            or clarification of a previous statement. When you see "i.e." in a
            sentence, it's typically followed by an explanation or further
            details that help to clarify or provide additional context for what
            was just mentioned. It is often used to avoid ambiguity and ensure
            the reader or listener fully understands the intended meaning.) a
            digital form of paying for goods and services and exchanging money
            over the internet. Way back in 2009 when Bitcoin was first invented,
            most people didn't believe that it would be a viable form of
            currency, but over the last decade plus, as Bitcoin has become more
            and more popular, people are starting to say that maybe Bitcoin
            could be the currency of the future. Maybe in the future, maybe a
            few years, few decades from now, we'll be paying for goods and
            services using Bitcoin over the internet, rather than by using these
            old school, old fashioned centralized banking and government
            institutions to exchange U S dollars and our actual local
            currencies. Okay, so that was the currency part of it. We can think
            of Bitcoin or crypto as like "Internet Money" or like "Virtual
            Money" or "Virtual Currency".
            <br /><br />

            Let's now talk about the ledger system that holds it all together.
            And the thing to understand here is that Bitcoin is effectively one
            giant huge spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is called a ledger and in
            the spreadsheet we've got a record of every single Bitcoin
            transaction that has ever happened since January, 2009, when Bitcoin
            was, was first invented. And the way that I think of it in my head,
            it's like, let's say you're going on holiday with a group of friends
            and you don't wanna kind of keep on splitting the bill and handing
            over cash because that's a total nightmare. Therefore, someone makes
            a spreadsheet to keep track of who owes what. And so line one in the
            spreadsheet might be Yongjie owes Tianshuai 12 pounds, line two
            might be Erhu owes Ziqi, 18 pounds. And the idea is that as our
            holiday goes on, we would keep on adding stuff to our spreadsheet or
            a ledger. And at the end of the holiday, we would all settle up and
            then actual money would exchange hands. Now, assuming you trust your
            friends, to be honest this spreadsheet actually works reasonably
            well. You can basically treat this whole spreadsheet as virtual
            money. I am giving my friend virtual 10 pounds in exchange for them
            paying for dinner. Other friend is giving me virtual 20 pounds in
            exchange for me paying for the boat ride. Now that's fine for a
            group of a few people on holiday but imagine hypothetically, if the
            whole world were to run on a similar spreadsheet, where instead of
            money ever exchanging hands like physically it would just be a line
            item in the spreadsheet. Now imagine a world in which everyone
            trusted the spreadsheet and everyone was being honest and good and
            nice and friendly, and only adding legitimate things to the
            spreadsheet that everyone agreed on. That's basically what Bitcoin
            is. It's this giant spreadsheet that keeps track of absolutely every
            single transaction that's ever happened regarding Bitcoin since the
            start of Bitcoin. And so that means that this spreadsheet has a
            record of everyone in the world who has ever bought and sold Bitcoin
            and it tells you how much Bitcoin they've bought and sold, so you
            can work out how much Bitcoin each person has in their account.
            <br /><br />

            Now let's say I have two Bitcoins in my account which is quite a lot
            of money these days. And I were to give one Bitcoin a friend we
            could add to this spreadsheet. Yongjie gives one Bitcoin to Ziqi.
            And because it's all in one spreadsheet the spreadsheet knows that
            my Bitcoin account has now one Bitcoin and Ziqi's Bitcoin account
            now has one Bitcoin in it as well. Now, fundamentally, this is all
            Bitcoin really is. It's just a giant spreadsheet but it's got some
            other fancy features that make it really really clever, and that
            make it a potential candidate for the currency of the future. See,
            the problem with our ledger system is that if it's on a spreadsheet
            usually it's one person who's maintaining the spreadsheet. So let's
            say I'm on holiday with friends and everyone trusts me to do this,
            to be the spreadsheet guy because I'm a massive nerd. And therefore,
            anytime they want to post a transaction they would say, Hey,
            Yongjie, Baoqiang has given Lucia 10 pounds and therefore I will add
            it to the spreadsheet. This is fine because my friends trust me and
            I'm a massive nerd, but we don't want a entire system of financial
            stuff based on this centralized model because that's kind of what we
            have already. Like every bank financial institution, government in
            the world is some sort of centralized authority that handles money.
            <br /><br />

            And so the US dollar is tied to the federal reserve and the US
            government, the UK pound is tied to the bank of England and then
            it's all somewhat related to like the international monetary fund.
            And then like the government has something to do with it. But
            essentially it's a small group of actors like governments and banks
            that manage the financial system for basically every country in the
            world. And so the third part of our definition of a cryptocurrency
            is that it needs to be decentralized and the way that Bitcoin and
            all these other cryptocurrencies work is that there is no central
            person in charge of them. There is no one person or one company
            saying, Hey, I have got the master spreadsheet. Instead, what
            happens is that every single person in the world can have a copy of
            that master spreadsheet if they want. And so with Bitcoin, for
            example, there are millions of people around the world on their
            computers who each have a copy of the master spreadsheet. And each
            of those computers are running software that's constantly checking
            to make sure that master spreadsheet is legit. And it's the same as
            every other copy of the master spreadsheet on the network. And that
            means that if you wanna hack a Bitcoin it's quite hard to do because
            there's like millions of people all around the world who are helping
            to maintain it. And it means that if you want to unduly influence
            stuff like if you're a bank or a government or some other evil
            person, it's quite hard to do because again, it's decentralized. It
            means that it's being maintained and managed by millions of people
            all around the world, from their computers. And now we get to the
            final part of our definition which is that this whole system is
            built and secured using cryptography.
            <br /><br />
            <img
              class="article-picture"
              src="/images/article/bitcoin.jpg"
              alt=""
            />

            So cryptography is a branch of maths and computer science that's
            associated whether with like code making and code breaking and
            cryptography is how all of our communications are encrypted. So for
            example, when you send a WhatsApp message there is no way that
            WhatsApp or Facebook can read the message because it's encrypted by
            cryptography on either end. And so only the sender and the recipient
            can see what the message is. No one in the middle can see what the
            messages is, it's become encrypted, it's just like a bunch of
            numbers that no one can interpret. And the really clever thing about
            Bitcoin and these other cryptocurrencies is that they use
            cryptography to solve the problem of trust and to solve the problem
            of centralization. The problem of trust is that, you know, when I'm
            on holiday with my friends, we all trust each other and we know that
            no one's gonna screw anyone over but in real life, that doesn't
            necessarily happen. So your system needs to be secure enough so as
            not to rely on trusting individuals. And secondly, the problem of
            centralization, i.e. it can't just be Google owning a Google sheet
            that everyone gets a copy of because Google controls it. It can't
            just be Amazon, it can't be the US government, it can't be the bank
            of England. It needs to be truly decentralized in a way that
            everyone maintains and manages the system. All right, now it's time
            for a little basic introduction to the world of cryptography.
            <br /><br />

            This is a little bit complicated. Essentially it cryptography is
            really, really cool. And I am just now kind of dabbling in the world
            of cryptography and trying to understand it. So here are a few
            concepts and how I've kind of explained it to myself in my head.
            Essentially, a cryptography is based around the use of one way
            functions called hash functions. And the idea behind there is that
            you can put any message or anything through a hash function and it
            will spit out a totally random combination of letters and numbers on
            the other end in such a way that you can then reverse the function.
            And so if we were to take my name and put it through a hash function
            called SHA-256 which is the one that Bitcoin uses but explaining it
            is a bit too hard. We'll come out with this random string of letters
            and numbers. And now, if you were to just look at that random string
            of letters and numbers there is no way you can reverse the chain to
            go back to what the original message was.
            <br /><br />

            Now, Bitcoin uses these hash functions to solve both those problems.
            It solves the problem of trust by using digital signatures based
            around, secret keys and public keys in this thing called "Public Key
            Cryptography". And essentially it means that you as an individual
            can have a secret key, a password that no one else knows, but then
            you have a public key which is sort of related to your password
            which other people do know, but that's fine because they can never
            find out your true password. And as long as you use your true
            password to sign your messages, it's 100%, basically 100% guaranteed
            that those messages are legit. So that kind of solves the trust
            problem. And we solved the decentralization problem by using this
            concept called "Proof of Work" where all of the different people on
            the network, on the Bitcoin network who are maintaining the system,
            are called "Bitcoin Miners" and what these guys try and do is they
            essentially try and solve a "Hash Puzzle", which just requires lots
            and lots and lots of computing power effectively involves guessing
            multiple numbers, multiple, multiple times. And this is a sort of
            lottery between everyone on the network, so that if you are the
            lucky person, who's plucked the random number out of thin air that
            solves the "Hash Puzzle" then your spreadsheet kind of gets saved
            and then that saved state is permanent, and then you get rewarded
            with some Bitcoin for giving up your computing power to help kind of
            maintain the whole thing. And I'm using a lot of jargon and this is
            actually very hard to break down in like an easy way.
            <br /><br /><br />
          </p>
          <h3>Part2</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            Let's now move on to topic number two. Why is Bitcoin and crypto so
            controversial? So there's broadly four reasons as to why Bitcoin is
            controversial. Number one, the speculative bubble, number two, the
            environmental impact, number three security issues and number four,
            the threat of illegal activity. Firstly, a lot of people say that
            Bitcoin is a speculative bubble. The price of Bitcoin is not based.
            People say on any intrinsic value behind Bitcoin. It is in fact
            based on people like you and me thinking, Oh my God, Bitcoin's a big
            deal. Therefore we buy it and therefore supply and demand means that
            the price goes up. People have been saying this since like 2011 when
            the price of Bitcoin was absolutely nothing compared to the like the
            $25,000 that it is now. And yes there is an extent to which Bitcoin
            is a speculative bubble. And in fact, when I invest in Bitcoin I
            don't really think of it as investing, I do in fact, think of it as
            gambling which I'm gonna talk a little bit more about later. And
            people would say that, for example, when Elon Musk tweets that he's
            about to buy a Bitcoin suddenly the price sores really, really,
            really high that is not the sign of how a market would respond to an
            underlying value increase. It is in fact how the market would
            respond to speculation. Elon Musk is buying Bitcoin therefore, every
            one of the world is like, Oh my God Elon Musk is buying Bitcoin
            therefore they buy Bitcoin, therefore the price goes up. It's not
            like Bitcoin has fundamentally changed because of Elon Musk's tweet.
            It's just that people are speculating at it which is why it's this
            sort of speculative bubble. <br /><br />

            Secondly, Bitcoin is controversial because of the energy consumption
            and alleged environmental impact of the technology. So because it is
            kind of decentralized and run by zillions of computers, zillions of
            nodes, all around the world people would say that those nodes use
            lots and lots of energy use lots of computing power, therefore lots
            of electricity in order to solve the hash puzzles that the whole
            Bitcoin system is based around. Now, the anti Bitcoin people would
            say that this use of energy is not very good because it's bad for
            the environment and it's causing carbon to go into the atmosphere,
            etc, etc just to maintain a system. Whereas the pro Bitcoin people
            would say, yeah, that's true but like we need to use energy to
            maintain any system and the actual banking industry uses far more
            energy than Bitcoin does or will in the near future. And they would
            say that these kinds of Bitcoin mining farms are in countries like
            Iceland and Greenland, where it's very cold and where there's very
            like lots of cold air. And therefore the cooling of it becomes more
            efficient. Ultimately, I don't know what the answer is, there are
            pros and cons. Everything kind of uses energy. People say Bitcoin is
            bad because it uses more energy than it should. I don't know, I'm
            just, you know, don't shoot the messenger. That is just one of the
            reasons
            <br /><br />

            As to why people think Bitcoin is a bit controversial. Thirdly,
            Bitcoin is controversial because people are sometimes worried about
            security issues. Now, theoretically, the whole system is sort of
            decentralized and trustless and like, you know, maintained by these
            millions of nodes all around the world. In practice, there are these
            things called "Crypto Exchanges", now these are big companies sort
            of like the London stock exchange and the New York stock exchange.
            They're an exchange that connects buyers to sellers. And because a
            lot of people who have accounts on these exchanges also use the
            exchange to store their Bitcoin. Like the exchange also stores
            Bitcoin for you. Like I have all my Bitcoin and Coinbase. If
            Coinbase were to get hacked for whatever reason then I might lose my
            Bitcoin. And in the past kind of decade there've been quite a few
            high profile hacking instances where the exchange has been targeted
            and users have lost their crypto. In practice, this is not something
            that I am personally particularly worried about. If you're worried
            about it, you can do lots and lots of other things to secure your
            Bitcoin like use a hardware wallet. There's loads of bilibili videos
            explaining that kind of outside the scope of this one. But security
            issues is reason number three, why Bitcoin is controversial.
            <br /><br />

            And reason number four, is the fact that Bitcoin is sometimes used
            as a form of payment for illegal activities. Like let's say you
            wanna buy drugs or you wanna buy bad things on the dark web or
            whatever that means. You can pay in Bitcoin and you can receive
            Bitcoin and theoretically, your Bitcoin username is like a random
            string of letters and numbers that is not directly tied to you as an
            individual. And therefore Bitcoin is a way that unscrupulous people
            across the internet can facilitate payments without needing to
            verify their identity with anyone. In fairness, people can also do
            illegal things with US dollars and every other form of currency in
            the world. But people would say like the anti Bitcoin people would
            say, Bitcoin is bad because it's fundamentally anonymous. And
            therefore, you never know who the actual person is on the other end,
            unless you kind of trust them initially. And therefore, because this
            even more facilitates the use of illegal activities, this is
            therefore bad. I don't buy that argument personally. I mean the
            internet itself can be a good or bad thing depending on the context
            in which it's used. I personally think Bitcoin could be the future
            and it is broadly a good thing, but of course it could be a bad
            thing depending on how it's used.

          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            This article derives from Ali Abdaal, a doctor turned entrepreneur
            based on Cambridge University. At the beginning, he explained the
            essence of currency, that is, a type of good that accredited by
            everyone no matter if it has its intrinsic value. The critical
            phrase is currency is kind of just an abstract way that we've all
            agreed to value things in a certain way. In that respect, Bitcoin
            itself is accredited by people. Meanwhile, it is one of the reasons
            that why some people hold the idea that bitcoin is risky or
            controversial, i.e., the speculative bubble which I will mention
            later. Next, he gave a metaphor that bitcoin resemble a ledger
            system—a ledger system track everyone’s transaction. Third, the
            third part of definition of a cryptocurrency is that it needs to be
            decentralized and the way that Bitcoin and all these other
            cryptocurrencies work is that there is no central person in charge
            of them. Unlike US dollar or other currency published by the
            government, every single person in the world can have a copy of that
            master spreadsheet. Then he leads to the concept the trust problem,
            due to bitcoin is a huge system and decentralized, it has to be
            super secure, so the concept “Public Key Cryptography” was brought
            on the table. People who maintain this system is called “Bicton
            Miners.” That leads to another controversial topic that Bicton
            Miners is kind a waste of natural resource and caused environmental
            crisis. The next part author explain why Bicton is so controversial.
            Except for two reasons I mentioned above (speculative bubble, a
            waste of resource and cause environment degradation), the other
            reasons: security issue, which means it has the risk hacked by
            others; the threat of illegal activities which means some sort of
            dark web where people can take advantage of Bitcoin’s feature that
            people who dabble in transaction is totally anonymous.
